# Digit-Recognition-By-Tesseract
This project uses Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine, to recognize digits from an image. Tesseract is trained on a dataset of images containing digits and used to extract the digits from a given image. The output is a set of recognized digits that can be used for further processing or analysis.
